# HIIN CDS Tools 
This repository contains several tools to assist states and hospitals working with HRET's CDS data extracts.
Written in Python they include the ability to:
* Generate performance and comparative graphs per facility as well as state-wide from a CDS export.
* Split CDS exports to improve usability of the HIIN Improvement Calculator.
* Copy individual CDS exports and calculators into hospital based sub-folders.

We may at a future date provide the same tools written in R.
